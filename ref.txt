#When we are sending readable stream with our body it's not safe to throw errors without ensuring that the server still listenning to the readable stream,
#Therefor we have to manually close the readable stream to avoid server interrupt.

@Column('int', { select: false })
total: number;
(await this.getRepository(JobCategory))
      .createQueryBuilder('category')
      .addSelect('COUNT(jobs.id)', 'category_total')
      .leftJoin('category.jobs', 'jobs')
      .groupBy('category.id')
      .orderBy('category.name', 'ASC')
      .getMany();
In my query builder I added an addSelect() with first parameter as COUNT(jobs.id) and second parameter for an alias as category_total.
Note: As you can see I have prepend category_ to the alias total, this will map the total column to the actual result of category entity. Without category_ in the alias the total column will not be visible.
