# Playboy
# Whole
# SELECT c.*, COUNT(c.id) as count FROM comment AS c LEFT JOIN comment AS cs  ON c.userId = cs.userId AND c.description <= cs.description GROUP BY c.id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 2;

# Step 1
# 12 row * 1 row has 6 same userId(category), LEFT JOIN will return 72 (12*6) rows
# SELECT c.* from comment c LEFT JOIN comment as c2 ON c.userId = c2.userId;

# Step 2
# id, ..., count(6) since every id occurred 6 times, need to eliminate/sort element and remove rows (Therefore we use c.id >= c2.id)
# SELECT c.*, count(c.id) from comment c LEFT JOIN comment as c2 ON c.userId = c2.userId GROUP BY c.id;
